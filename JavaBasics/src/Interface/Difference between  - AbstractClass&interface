Difference between  - AbstractClass & interface

AbstractClass
1.abstract class can be created with the keyword "abstract".
2.abstract class can have both concrete & abstract method.
3.multiple level of inheritance we can not achieve in abstract class.
4.in abstract class we can achieve 0-100% abstraction.
5.abstract class can inheritance interface using "implements" keyword.	
6.all the methods under interface is public.
7.abstract class can inheritance concrete class. 


Interface
1.interface can be created with keyword "Interface".
2.interface can have only abstract methods.
3.interface can help to achieve multiple level inheritance.
4.in interface we can achieve 100% abstraction.(abstraction which means complete hiding).
5.in interface can inheritance another interface using "extends" keyword.
6.all the methods under abstract class is not public.
7.interface can never inheritance another class.
